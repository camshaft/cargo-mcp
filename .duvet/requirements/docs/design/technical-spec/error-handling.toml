# Error Handling
#
# 🚧 The server MUST return appropriate error responses for all failure cases.
# 
# ✓ The server MUST return a "not found" error when a requested crate does not exist.
# 
# ✓ The server MUST return an "invalid parameters" error when an invalid version is specified.
# 
# ✓ The server MUST return an "internal error" for command execution failures.
# 
# ✓ The server MUST return an "internal error" for parsing failures.
# 
# ❌ The server MUST provide error messages that are helpful for debugging.
# 
# ❌ The server SHOULD log detailed error information for debugging purposes.
